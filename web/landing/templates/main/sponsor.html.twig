{%- endblock -%}

{%- block description -%}
    Flow is a PHP-based, strongly typed data processing framework with low memory footprint that can process various data sources consistently.
    It offers a unified API for all data sources, including CSV, JSON, XML, Text, Parquet, Avro, Rest API, RDBMS, Elasticsearch / Meilisearch.
    Flow not only enables you to process various data sources consistently, but also strives to accurately detect data types and cast them to the appropriate PHP types.

                Flow PHP was originally inspired by the need for rapid, flexible data processing flows in modern PHP applications. Through the project, I aim to lessen the complexity of event-based architectures while providing maintainable, tested, and production-ready tools. Your sponsorship will help grow the project furtherâ€”funding more in-depth documentation, additional features, and a sustainable roadmap. Thank you for supporting open-source innovation!
