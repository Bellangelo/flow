{%- endblock -%}

{%- block description -%}
    Flow is a PHP-based, strongly typed data processing framework with low memory footprint that can process various data sources consistently.
    It offers a unified API for all data sources, including CSV, JSON, XML, Text, Parquet, Avro, Rest API, RDBMS, Elasticsearch / Meilisearch.
    Flow not only enables you to process various data sources consistently, but also strives to accurately detect data types and cast them to the appropriate PHP types.

                We completely respect your decision to reject cookies. However, before you go,
                we’d like to share why these cookies are so vital for our open-source project’s
                progress.

            <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl">1. Showing Us What Matters</h2>
            <p class="mt-2">
                Cookies let us see which features people use the most and where improvements
                are truly needed. We don’t track personal information—only anonymized statistics
                that reveal which parts of our project spark the most interest.
            </p>

            <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl">2. Fueling Our Motivation</h2>
            <p class="mt-2">
                We’re a team of open-source enthusiasts, and seeing active engagement gives us
                a real morale boost. When we notice spikes in traffic or a rise in feature usage,
                it affirms that the community finds our work valuable, and it inspires us to
                keep innovating.
            </p>

            <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl">3. Free & Always Improving</h2>
            <p class="mt-2">
                By understanding usage trends, we can direct our time and limited resources
                toward the features that matter most. This ensures our project remains free,
                relevant, and beneficial for everyone who relies on it.
            </p>

            <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl">4. Respecting Your Data</h2>
            <p class="mt-2">
                We take privacy seriously. Any information gathered remains anonymous and
                helps us enhance functionality based on collective interests rather than
                individual profiles.
