# Installation

- [⬅️️ Back](introduction.md)

## Installation Methods

- [Docker](installation/docker.md)
- [PHAR with PHIVE](installation/phive.md)
- [Homebrew](installation/homebrew.md)
- [Quick Start](quick-start.md)

## Composer

If you want to work with JSON/CSV files here are the dependencies you will need to install:

```bash
composer require flow-php/etl flow-php/etl-adapter-csv flow-php/etl-adapter-json
```

Flow is developed as
a [monorepo](https://tomasvotruba.com/blog/2019/10/28/all-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-monorepo-but-were-afraid-to-ask/)
to reduce maintenance overhead and to make it easier to manage dependencies between components.

Instead of installing whole repository with all dependencies, it's recommended to install only the components you need.
