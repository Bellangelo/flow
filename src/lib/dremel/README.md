# Dremel

> [!WARNING]  
> This library is not ready yet. Currently, the implementation of the algorithms described in [this document](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~adityagp/courses/cs598/papers/dremel.pdf) is located directly in the flow-php/parquet repository.
> To be able to extract the algorithms that allow flattening and rebuilding nested data structures, we will need to move several elements from the parquet library to the dremel library. 
> Here are some of them:
> 
> - Schema
> - Repetitions
> - DremelShredder 
> - DremelAssembler

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This repository is a subtree split from our monorepo. If you'd like to contribute, please visit our main monorepo [flow-php/flow](https://github.com/flow-php/flow).
